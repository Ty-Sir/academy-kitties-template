This is a Crypto Kitties based clone built using a template given by Ivan On Tech's blockchain dev bootcamp course.

You can create, breed, collect, buy, or sell unique digital cats based on the ERC-721 standard.

The initial project only allowed the owner of the Cat Contract to create generation zero cats, but to allow a more open environment I removed
the onlyOwner modifier. This now lets any user create a generation zero cat until 30 total are made. After that all new cats are made through
breeding in the breed page. There is no limit as to how many can be made this way.
